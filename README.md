# TerminalJS
Terminal simulator written in JavaScript and CSS, based on knight-ryu12's work

## Notes
The script gets the text it displays from a file called `text.txt`. This will not run in Chrome locally, because Chrome does not allow cross-origin requests to local files (`file:///`). You can however run Chrome with local file access enabled or use a local webserver.

## Credits
Original concept and codebase by [knight-ryu12](https://github.com/knight-ryu12) with contributions by HM892 and kenn.

The font is [PlexMono by IBM](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/IBM+Plex+Mono).
